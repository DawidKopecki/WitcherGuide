    <p><b> The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is an action role-playing game with a third-person perspective. Players control Geralt of Rivia, a monster slayer known as a Witcher. Geralt walks, runs, rolls and dodges, and (for the first time in the series) jumps, climbs and swims.He has a variety of weapons, including bombs, a crossbow and two swords (one steel and one silver).The steel sword is used primarily to kill humans while the silver sword is more effective against creatures and monsters.
