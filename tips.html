    Roach is probably your best partner in the game, though it can get tiresome to always have to keep an eye on its stamina if you’re galloping. If you’re on a road, however, a top Witcher 3 tip is to double tap the designated button and Roach will just keep traversing forward on its own. Just move to either the left or the right side from time to time to keep on the right track, and the rest will be automatic without the loss of stamina.

            <h2>In combat, learn the difference between dodging and rolling </h2>
            <img src="images/combat.jpg" alt="persons face">
        <p style="color: red"> <b>
    You don’t need someone to tell you that rolling and dodging two different actions, but in The Witcher 3, there's a key difference in when you choose to use them. Whenever Geralt dodges, he makes a short and quick movement in the direction you press with the dodge button simultaneously. Rolling’s action is similar, but you cover more ground and the animation takes longer until he’s back on his feet. Both are great for close quarters combat, but if you’re fighting a bandit or a Drowner, dodging can grant you the small window you need to strike back as your foe misses. Rolling works best when you’re facing bigger enemies that usually have more undodgeable attacks, or those who cover a wider area with each swing, like Golems. Practicing both movements and learning enemy patterns is key to succeed in your contracts.

    Your progress is automatically saved after each completed objective and at various other checkpoints while working through quests, but due to the unpredictability of events in the world it's risky to rely on this while out exploring. So a top Witcher 3 tip is that of you're not following a particular quest then make sure you make regular manual saves. That way you won't lose too much progress should you get ambushed or accidentally fall off a cliff.
